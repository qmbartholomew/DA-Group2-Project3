# 5-8-13 Moving Average | DA-Group2-Project3 

## Project Summary

- In this project we will dive into the finance world to see if the 5/8/13 simple moving average method within the foreign exchange market is profitable or not. To showcase our hypothesis that it is profitable, we will be using the data visualization route as well as a little bit of the data engineering route.
