# 5-8-13 Moving Average | DA-Group2-Project3 

## Project Summary

- In this project we will dive into the finance world to see if the 5/8/13 simple moving average method within the foreign exchange market is profitable or not. To showcase our hypothesis that it is profitable, we will be using the data visualization route as well as a little bit of the data engineering route.

## Usage Instructions 

### Prerequisites
 - [Node.js/Npm](https://nodejs.org/)
 - AngularCLI (Step 2 of instructions)

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install Angular CLI using npm or whichever of your preferred package manager `npm i @angular/cli`.
3. Install dependencies using the `npm i` command.
4. Open a terminal to DA-Group2-Project3\Project-3\Backend and run the `pip install Flask flask-cors pandas`command.
5. Run the backend by using the `python app.py` command.
6. Open a separate terminal to Project-3\Frontend\Project-3\src\app and run the application using the `ng serve` command.

## Technologies Used
- Python + Flask
- JavaScript/TypeScript + Angular
- SQLite

## Other Tools and Libraries
- ChatGPT assisted in a number of ways:
    - Troubleshooting code
    - Providing guidance on possible theories to test
- StackOverflow provided assistance when troubleshooting code.
- Many of JavaScript's and Python's libraries were utilized in the data processing and visualization process:
    - Plotly for data visualization
    - Flask for serving the data from the SQLite database
    - Typescript/Angular for building the website's UI

## How to interact with the data:
We’ve made it easy to interact with our dataset by providing a toggle feature that allows you to switch between the three foreign currencies we analyzed. This feature allows you to see the trend for each currency via the 5/8/13 strategy in the span of a year. You are also able to zoom in ands pan over the sections of the data you would like to focus on with the icons in the upper right of the line chart.

## Ethical Consideration
We wouldn't say there was much ethical considerations needed since what we are analyzing doesn’t really affect any sort of ethics in a positive/negative way. We simply are analyzing the 5/8/13 trading strategy and whether it is a good strategy to utilize in mostly short term trading environments.
